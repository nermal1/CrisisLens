### The Crisis: What Happened and Why
The GameStop squeeze was not driven by macroeconomics, but by a coordinated "David vs. Goliath" narrative. Retail investors on the Reddit community **r/wallstreetbets** identified that GameStop was shorted at over 140% of its float. By buying shares and call options en masse, they forced hedge funds to buy back shares at ballooning prices to cover their losses, sending the stock from under $20 to an intraday high of $483.

> **The Turning Point:** On January 28, 2021, major brokers like Robinhood restricted the purchase of GME, citing clearinghouse collateral requirements. This "buying halt" broke the momentum and caused the price to crater, leading to a massive PR crisis and congressional hearings.

### The Recovery: A "New Normal"
This was not a traditional recovery. The stock price became decoupled from its earnings. While it crashed back to the $40 range (pre-split) within two weeks, it remained a "permanent" meme stock with frequent, unpredictable spikes.



* **The Catalyst:** The momentum was broken by the brokerage "buying halt," allowing institutional shorts to reposition in a less chaotic environment.
* **Recovery Type:** Volatility Spike / Fragmented. The stock never returned to "fundamental" value; it became a vehicle for social sentiment.

### Lessons for Investors
* 📊 **Technicals vs. Fundamentals** — In the short term, supply and demand (liquidity) matter more than a company's balance sheet.
* 🧨 **The Power of the Float** — Short interest over 20% is high; over 100% is a powder keg. Always check the "Short Interest % of Float."
* 🏛️ **Brokerage Risk** — Your ability to trade depends on your broker's liquidity. In extreme volatility, "the house" can change the rules to protect the system.
* 🎯 **Exit Strategy is Vital** — In a squeeze, the "top" is a needle-thin peak. Taking profits on the way up is the only way to avoid "holding the bag."
