### The Crash: What Happened and Why
The Dot-com bubble was a historic period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1995 to 2000. Investors poured capital into any company with a ".com" suffix, often disregarding traditional metrics like P/E ratios in favor of "eyes on page" or "burn rates." When the venture capital dried up and companies failed to turn a profit, the market realized the valuations were based on hype rather than math.

> **The Catalyst:** A combination of rising interest rates, a multi-billion dollar sell order from Japan, and the realization that many "internet darlings" were burning through cash with no path to profitability.

### Timeline of the Crash
* **March 10, 2000:** The Nasdaq Composite peaks at 5,048.62, more than doubling in a single year.
* **April 2000:** The bubble begins to leak. Stocks like Microsoft face antitrust rulings, and the "New Economy" narrative starts to crumble.
* **2001:** The crash is exacerbated by the 9/11 attacks and major accounting scandals like Enron and WorldCom, which shattered investor trust.
* **October 9, 2002:** The Nasdaq hits its ultimate trough of 1,114.11, a staggering **78% drop** from its peak.

### Quick Stats
* **Date Range:** March 2000 – October 2002.
* **Severity Level:** High (Level 9/10). While the S&P 500 fell 49%, the technology sector faced a near-total wipeout of speculative capital.

### Winners and Losers

<WinnerBox>
- **Cisco Systems:** Surged +3,800% during the build-up; though it fell in the crash, it survived as a hardware backbone.
- **Microsoft:** Despite antitrust battles, it retained market dominance and massive cash reserves.
- **Amazon:** One of the few dot-coms that survived a 90% price drop to eventually dominate global retail.
- **Value Stocks:** As tech crashed, investors rotated into "Old Economy" stocks like Philip Morris and Berkshire Hathaway.

<LoserBox>
- **Pets.com:** The poster child for the bubble; went from IPO to liquidation in just 268 days.
- **Webvan:** A grocery delivery startup that burned through $1.2 billion before declaring bankruptcy.
- **WorldCom:** Exposed in a massive accounting fraud after the bubble burst, leading to the largest bankruptcy in history at the time.
- **Telecom Infrastructure:** Massive overcapacity led to a sector-wide collapse (e.g., Global Crossing).

### The Recovery: The Long Road Back
The recovery was a slow, grinding **U-Shape**. It took years for investors to regain confidence in the technology sector.



* **The Catalyst:** The emergence of "Web 2.0" and the mobile revolution (iPhone) eventually proved that the internet *was* the future, just not at the 1999 prices.
* **Recovery Time:** It took the S&P 500 until **May 2007** (roughly 7 years) to reach new highs. The Nasdaq didn't return to its 2000 peak until **April 2015**—a 15-year recovery period.

### Lessons for Investors
* 📉 **Valuation Always Matters** — "This time is different" is the most expensive phrase in finance. Cash flow eventually trumps "growth potential."
* 🧩 **Sector Concentration is Dangerous** — Diversification is the only "free lunch." Those 100% in tech faced a decade of losses.
* 🌪️ **Survivorship Bias** — We remember Amazon and Google, but we forget the thousands of companies that went to zero.
* 🛑 **Don't Marry a Stock** — Being right about the *technology* (the internet) doesn't mean you are right about the *price* of the stock.
