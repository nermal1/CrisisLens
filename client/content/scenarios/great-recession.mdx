### The Crisis: What Happened and Why
The 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC) was the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression. It was a structural failure of the global banking system caused by years of issuing high-risk mortgages to borrowers with poor credit. These loans were bundled into complex securities and sold worldwide. When house prices stopped rising and borrowers defaulted, these "toxic assets" caused a global liquidity freeze.

> **The "Heart Attack" Moment:** The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, sent shockwaves through the global financial system, requiring unprecedented government intervention to prevent a total collapse.

### Timeline of the Crisis
* **2006 – Early 2007:** The U.S. housing bubble peaks. Interest rates rise, causing subprime borrowers to default.

* **October 3, 2008:** President Bush signs the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program), a $700 billion bailout for the banking sector.
* **March 9, 2009:** The S&P 500 hits its "generational bottom" at 666 points—roughly 57% below its 2007 peak.

### The Recovery: Timing & Shape
The recovery was a **U-Shaped** "Balance Sheet Recession." Unlike the 1987 crash, consumers and banks spent years paying down debt rather than spending or lending. 

* **The Catalyst:** Massive "Quantitative Easing" (QE) by the Federal Reserve and near-zero interest rates.
* **Recovery Time:** It took the S&P 500 until **March 2013 (roughly 5 years)** to regain its 2007 peak. Unemployment didn't fully recover until 2016.

### Lessons for Investors
* 💧 **Liquidity is King** — In a systemic crisis, having cash to meet obligations is the only thing that prevents bankruptcy.
* 🔍 **Understand the "Underlying"** — Never invest in complex financial products if you don't understand the physical asset backing it.
* 🏠 **Real Estate is Not Risk-Free** — The crisis destroyed the long-held myth that "home prices always go up."
* 🏦 **Don't Fight the Fed** — Once the Fed committed to "unlimited" support in 2009, the market eventually bottomed out despite the headlines.
