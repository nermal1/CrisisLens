### The Crash: What Happened and Why
Black Monday was a sudden, severe, and largely unexpected global stock market crash. It began in Hong Kong, spread through Europe, and culminated in the United States, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plummeted by over 22% in a single trading session. Unlike the 1929 crash, the 1987 event was a sharp, technical "flash" event that did not result in a long-term economic collapse.

> **Why markets fell:** A "perfect storm" of high valuations, geopolitical jitters in the Persian Gulf, and computerized "portfolio insurance" programs that triggered a recursive feedback loop of automatic selling.

### Timeline of the Crash
* **August 25, 1987:** The DJIA peaks at 2,722, capping a five-year bull market that saw stocks triple in value.
* **October 14–16, 1987:** The "warning shots." Markets drop significantly due to high trade deficits. A massive storm in London closes markets early on Friday, increasing uncertainty.
* **October 19, 1987 (Black Monday):** Markets open with a massive wave of sell orders. Computerized programs trigger automatic selling as prices drop. By 4:00 PM, the DJIA is down 508.32 points (22.61%).
* **October 20, 1987:** The Federal Reserve intervenes, pledging to provide liquidity to the financial system.

### The Recovery: Timing & Shape
The recovery featured a **V-Shaped** initial bounce followed by a steady climb. The Federal Reserve’s quick action to slash interest rates and provide liquidity prevented a banking collapse.

* **Recovery Time:** The DJIA recovered 57% of its losses within just two trading days, but it took until **September 1989 (roughly 2 years)** to return to pre-crash peaks.

### Lessons for Investors
* ⚖️ **Margin is a Double-Edged Sword** — Many traders were wiped out by "margin calls" as account values plummeted.
* 🌐 **Diversification Isn't a Cure-All** — During a crash, correlations often go to 1.0; almost everything (except cash) falls together.
* 🏦 **Don't Fight the Fed** — Central bank liquidity can stop a market panic from becoming an economic depression.
* 🧘 **Stay Calm** — Investors who held on were back to "even" within two years.
