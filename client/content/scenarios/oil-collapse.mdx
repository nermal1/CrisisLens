### The Collapse: What Happened and Why
The 2014–2016 Oil Price Collapse signaled the end of the "commodity supercycle." It transformed the global economy from one struggling with high energy costs to one grappling with a massive supply glut. Global oil prices plummeted from over $100 per barrel to under $30 per barrel in less than two years.

> **The Catalyst:** This was sparked by the American shale revolution and a strategic decision by OPEC (led by Saudi Arabia) to maintain high production levels to "squeeze out" high-cost producers and regain market share.

### Timeline of the Collapse
* **June 2014:** Brent crude peaks at roughly $115 per barrel.
* **November 2014 (The OPEC Bombshell):** OPEC decides *not* to cut production despite falling prices, aiming to make U.S. shale drilling unprofitable.
* **January 2016:** Fears of a Chinese economic slowdown and the lifting of Iranian sanctions push prices to historic lows.
* **February 11, 2016 (The Bottom):** WTI Crude hits a bottom of **$26.05 per barrel**.
* **Late 2016:** The birth of "OPEC+" (OPEC and Russia) leads to coordinated production cuts, finally providing a floor for the market.

### Winners and Losers

<WinnerBox>
- **Airlines & Logistics:** Companies like Delta and FedEx saw profit margins soar as fuel costs—their biggest expense—evaporated.
- **The Average Consumer:** Lower gas prices acted as a "tax cut at the pump," increasing disposable income.
- **Oil Importers:** Countries like India and Japan saw their trade deficits shrink significantly.

### The Recovery: The "New Normal"
The recovery was **L-Shaped**. Prices didn't "bounce" back to $100; instead, they stabilized in a much lower range as the industry learned to be more efficient.



* **The Catalyst:** The formation of **OPEC+** to coordinate supply, combined with the bankruptcy of the weakest U.S. shale firms.
* **Recovery Time:** It took until late 2017 (roughly 3.5 years) for prices to stabilize consistently back above $60 per barrel.

### Lessons for Investors
* 🔄 **Commodities are Cyclical** — High prices are often the "cure" for high prices, as they incentivize overproduction.
* 🗺️ **Geopolitics vs. Economics** — Never assume OPEC will act as a stabilizer; their motivations are often political.
* ⚙️ **Efficiency Matters** — U.S. producers learned to produce oil at $40 that previously required $80, fundamentally changing the industry's cost structure.
* 📉 **The "Capex" Warning** — When energy companies spend record amounts on exploration, it is often a sign the market is overextended.
