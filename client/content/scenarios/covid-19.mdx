### The Crash: What Happened and Why
The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late 2019 and spread globally by early 2020. As the virus spread, governments imposed lockdowns, travel bans, and quarantines to slow transmission. These actions dramatically slowed economic activity—factories halted, travel stopped, and consumer demand plummeted. Investors reacted with fear and uncertainty, selling stocks en masse.

> **Why markets fell:** Global lockdowns caused massive economic disruption, investors feared a deep recession, and algorithms magnified sell-offs.
