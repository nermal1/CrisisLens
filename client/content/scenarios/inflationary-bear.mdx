### The Crisis: What Happened and Why
The 2021-2022 Bear Market was a fundamental repricing of risk. Following the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus of the COVID-19 era, global supply chains remained snarled while consumer demand surged. This led to "sticky" inflation that forced the Federal Reserve to abandon its "transitory" narrative. As interest rates rose at the fastest pace in decades, the "discount rate" for future earnings increased, causing a massive sell-off in high-growth, unprofitable technology stocks.

> **The Geopolitical Catalyst:** Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 acted as an accelerant, sending global energy and food prices soaring and cementing the inflationary trend.

### The Recovery: The "Checkmark" Shape
The recovery was a grinding climb as the market adjusted to a "Higher for Longer" interest rate environment.



* **The Catalyst:** Inflation began a steady decline from its 9.1% peak, allowing the Fed to eventually pause rate hikes. The explosion of **Generative AI** in early 2023 provided the new growth narrative needed to lead the market to new highs.
* **Recovery Time:** **9 months.** The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high by January 2024, though many individual tech stocks still haven't recovered their 2021 peaks.

### Lessons for Investors
* 📉 **Don't Fight the Fed** — When the central bank is tightening liquidity, market multiples almost always shrink. 
* 💎 **Profitability is a Feature, Not an Option** — In a high-interest-rate world, investors value "dollars today" over "potential dollars in 2030."
* 🧩 **The 60/40 Portfolio Can Fail** — In inflationary environments, the traditional correlation between stocks and bonds breaks, and both can fall at once.
* 🛡️ **Real Assets Matter** — Having exposure to energy and commodities provides a vital hedge when the "digital" economy is under pressure.
