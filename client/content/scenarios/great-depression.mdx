### The Crisis: What Happened and Why
The Great Depression was a "perfect storm" of speculative excess, weak banking infrastructure, and disastrous monetary policy. Following a decade of prosperity in the "Roaring Twenties," the market became dangerously overextended. When the bubble burst on Black Tuesday, it triggered a massive deleveraging event. Unlike modern crises, the lack of federal deposit insurance (FDIC) meant that bank failures resulted in the total disappearance of personal savings, leading to a decade-long economic winter.

> **The Structural Failure:** Beyond the stock market, a global trade war—triggered by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act—collapsed international commerce, while the Federal Reserve's decision to tighten the money supply turned a recession into a full-scale Depression.

### Lessons for Investors
* 🏦 **The Importance of the "Fed Put"** — We learned that the central bank must act as the "lender of last resort" to prevent a liquidity squeeze from killing the economy.
* 🛡️ **Cash is the Ultimate Insurance** — In a deflationary spiral, cash is the only asset that gains purchasing power as everything else falls.
* 📜 **Don't Use Too Much Margin** — The 1929 crash was exacerbated by investors who had borrowed 90% of the money used to buy stocks.
* 🌐 **Policy Matters** — Government reactions (tariffs, tax hikes, or rate changes) can often turn a standard market correction into a generational catastrophe.
